# SPOTON
## Description:
GUTS Team 14 Project for JP Morgan
## Problem Statement:
Social media platform nowadays contains too much noise (eg. Selfies) which doesn't really promote cohesion-ness within small communities.
## Our solution:
Presenting to you SpotOn, an interactive social media platform which focuses on using a Map to help bring across Past, Present and Future Events for people in small social circles. 
Very ideal as it cuts off a lot of social media noises (eg. Selfies and stuffs) and helps promote people within a circle to visit past exciting places or join an event which is currently happening or happening in the near future!
## Possible Scenarios:
- Different departments within an office environment can use this app for cohesion purposes, even able to see and cross-join other department's cohesion by joining the groups respectively.
